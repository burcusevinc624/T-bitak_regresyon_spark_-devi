# Spark Regression Analysis for TÜBİTAK Project

This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence Specialist Training Program** organized by the Ministry of Industry and Technology and prepared for a **TÜBİTAK research project**.

## 🔍 Project Description

In this project, I used **Apache Spark** to perform **regression analysis** on large-scale datasets. The goal was to explore the relationship between variables and build a predictive model using distributed computing techniques.

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)**
- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Machine Learning (Regression Models)**
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**

## 📊 Key Tasks
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using Spark DataFrames
- Feature selection and engineering
- Building and evaluating regression models
- Model performance optimization
